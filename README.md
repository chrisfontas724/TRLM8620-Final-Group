# TRLM8620-Final
This is Software Funzone's final project for TRLM8620. We are Amory Mu, Anne Tran, Brian Hsieh, and Chris Fontas.

With our shared love of gaming, we are making a shopping website for Nintendo, where children all over the world are able to experience the beautiful joy of Kirby and his pink fluffiness. Our website is fully localized into Japanese, with some magical CSS replacing the original background, font and images to give you the magic of Nintendo.
